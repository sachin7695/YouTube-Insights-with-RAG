# Building a RAG application from scratch

This is a step-by-step guide to building a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Pinecone and OpenAI's API. The application will allow you to ask questions about any YouTube video.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a free Pinecone account and get your API key from [here](https://www.pinecone.io/).

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE]
PINECONE_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR PINECONE API KEY HERE]
PINECONE_API_ENV = [ENTER YOUR PINECONE API ENVIRONMENT HERE]
```
